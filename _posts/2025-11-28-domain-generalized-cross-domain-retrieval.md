## Introduction

This work addresses domain-generalized cross-domain image retrieval through unsupervised feature representation learning. The method aims to learn robust features that generalize across multiple domains.

## Key Contributions

- Domain generalization approach for cross-domain retrieval
- Unsupervised feature learning framework
- Generalization across multiple unseen domains

## Methodology

The proposed framework learns domain-generalized features that can be effectively used for retrieval across different domains without domain-specific adaptation.

## Results

Experimental results show improved generalization performance across various domain shifts in image retrieval tasks.
