## Introduction

Image processing involves manipulating digital images to enhance their quality, extract information, or prepare them for further analysis. It is widely used in medical imaging, photography, computer vision, and many other fields.

## Key Concepts

### Pixel Operations

Pixel operations are the most basic form of image processing, where each pixel is modified independently based on its value or position.

### Filtering

Filtering techniques are used to:
- Remove noise from images
- Enhance edges and features
- Smooth or sharpen images

Common filters include:
- **Gaussian Filter**: Used for noise reduction and smoothing
- **Median Filter**: Effective for removing salt-and-pepper noise
- **Sobel Filter**: Edge detection

### Image Enhancement

Image enhancement techniques improve the visual quality of images:
- **Histogram Equalization**: Improves contrast
- **Brightness/Contrast Adjustment**: Basic image corrections
- **Gamma Correction**: Adjusts image brightness

## Applications

Image processing basics are applied in:
- Medical image analysis
- Security and surveillance
- Quality control in manufacturing
- Digital photography

## Conclusion

Understanding the basics of image processing is essential for anyone working with digital images. These fundamental techniques form the foundation for more advanced computer vision and deep learning applications.
