## Introduction

This paper presents a correspondence-free domain alignment method for unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval. The approach eliminates the need for paired data between domains by learning domain-invariant representations.

## Key Contributions

- Correspondence-free learning framework that does not require paired samples
- Domain alignment strategy for cross-domain retrieval
- Effective feature learning without explicit domain correspondences

## Methodology

The proposed method learns domain-invariant features through alignment techniques that do not rely on correspondence information between domains.
