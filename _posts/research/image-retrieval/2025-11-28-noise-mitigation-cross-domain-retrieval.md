## Introduction

This paper addresses noise mitigation in unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval. The method focuses on handling noisy data and improving retrieval robustness.

## Key Contributions

- Noise mitigation framework for cross-domain retrieval
- Robust feature learning under noisy conditions
- Improved retrieval performance with noisy data

## Methodology

The proposed approach incorporates noise mitigation strategies to learn robust features that are less sensitive to noise in cross-domain retrieval scenarios.
