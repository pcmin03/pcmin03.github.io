# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data such as images.

## Architecture

### Convolutional Layers

Convolutional layers apply filters (kernels) to detect features:
- **Feature Detection**: Identifies patterns like edges, textures
- **Parameter Sharing**: Reduces number of parameters
- **Spatial Invariance**: Detects features regardless of position

### Pooling Layers

Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions:
- **Max Pooling**: Takes maximum value in each region
- **Average Pooling**: Takes average value
- **Purpose**: Reduces computation and overfitting

### Fully Connected Layers

Final layers that perform classification or regression based on extracted features.

## Popular Architectures

### LeNet
Early CNN for digit recognition.

### AlexNet
Breakthrough architecture that won ImageNet 2012.

### VGG
Deep network with small 3x3 filters.

### ResNet
Residual connections enable very deep networks (100+ layers).

## Applications

CNNs excel at:
- **Image Classification**: Identifying objects in images
- **Object Detection**: Locating and classifying objects
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Pixel-level classification
- **Medical Imaging**: Disease detection and diagnosis

## Training Considerations

- **Data Augmentation**: Increases dataset diversity
- **Transfer Learning**: Using pre-trained models
- **Regularization**: Dropout, batch normalization

## Conclusion

CNNs revolutionized computer vision and remain the foundation of modern image analysis systems.
