# 3D Mesh Processing

3D mesh processing involves manipulating polygonal meshes, which are fundamental representations of 3D objects.

## Mesh Representation

### Vertices, Edges, and Faces

A mesh consists of:
- **Vertices**: 3D points defining the shape
- **Edges**: Connections between vertices
- **Faces**: Polygons (typically triangles) forming the surface

### Data Structures

Common representations:
- **Vertex List + Face List**: Simple but inefficient
- **Half-Edge**: Efficient for topology queries
- **Winged-Edge**: Alternative topology structure

## Mesh Operations

### Simplification

Reducing polygon count while preserving shape:
- **Edge Collapse**: Merging vertices
- **Quadric Error Metrics**: Optimal simplification
- **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Multiple resolution versions

### Subdivision

Increasing mesh density:
- **Catmull-Clark**: For quad meshes
- **Loop Subdivision**: For triangle meshes
- **Smooth surfaces**: From coarse control meshes

### Smoothing

Removing noise and irregularities:
- **Laplacian Smoothing**: Average neighbor positions
- **Taubin Smoothing**: Prevents shrinkage
- **Bilateral Smoothing**: Preserves sharp features

## Mesh Analysis

### Topology Analysis
- Genus (number of holes)
- Euler characteristic
- Connected components

### Geometry Analysis
- Curvature computation
- Surface area and volume
- Feature detection

## Applications

- **3D Modeling**: CAD and animation
- **Medical Imaging**: Surface reconstruction from scans
- **Computer Graphics**: Game assets and rendering
- **3D Printing**: Mesh preparation and optimization

## File Formats

Common mesh formats:
- **OBJ**: Simple text format
- **PLY**: Polygon file format
- **STL**: For 3D printing
- **GLTF**: Modern web format

## Conclusion

3D mesh processing is essential for working with 3D models across many applications, from entertainment to medical imaging.
