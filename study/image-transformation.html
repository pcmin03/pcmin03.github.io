# Image Transformation and Warping

Image transformation and warping are essential techniques for geometric manipulation of images, enabling applications from image registration to creative effects.

## Geometric Transformations

### Affine Transformations

Affine transformations preserve parallel lines and include:
- **Translation**: Moving images
- **Rotation**: Rotating images around a point
- **Scaling**: Resizing images
- **Shearing**: Distorting images along axes

### Projective Transformations

Projective (homography) transformations can represent perspective changes, useful for:
- Image stitching
- Camera calibration
- Perspective correction

## Image Warping

Image warping involves non-linear transformations that can:
- Correct lens distortion
- Create artistic effects
- Align images from different viewpoints

### Warping Methods
- **Thin Plate Spline (TPS)**: Smooth warping
- **Mesh-based Warping**: Control point-based deformation
- **Optical Flow**: Motion-based warping

## Applications

- **Medical Imaging**: Image registration and alignment
- **Computer Graphics**: Texture mapping and morphing
- **Photography**: Perspective correction and panorama creation
- **Computer Vision**: Feature matching and tracking

## Implementation

Modern implementations use:
- Matrix operations for transformations
- Interpolation methods (bilinear, bicubic)
- GPU acceleration for real-time processing

## Conclusion

Image transformation and warping are powerful tools that enable sophisticated image manipulation and analysis across many domains.
